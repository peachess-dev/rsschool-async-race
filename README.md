# Async race
This is an implementation of my school project during the study in [RS School]()

**Task requirements (full description can be found [here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/async-race.md))**
-
- create SPA to manage the collection of the cars, operate its engines, and show races statistics

**Key skills**
- 
- Ð¡ommunication with a server (fetch, REST API)
- Async coding / Promises
- JS Animations
- DOM Api

**Live example**
-
To run the app you will have to install the server on your local machine first. In my school task, this was required so that the student could not change the backend code and cheat by replacing asynchronous requests with synchronous ones. Maybe I'll change this in the future and make it easier to see.
1. First you need to clone this repo: ``` $ git clone https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api.git. ```
2. Go to downloaded folder: ``` $ cd async-race-api. ```
3. Install dependencies: ``` $ npm install. ```
4. Run the server: ```$ npm start.```
5. Open it: http://127.0.0.1:3000.
6. Then finally open my project: [async-race app](https://peachess-dev.github.io/rsschool-async-race/dist/index.html)

**Addition**
-
I keep improving the application, adding necessary functionality and fixing bugs, so stay tuned for the latest changes.
